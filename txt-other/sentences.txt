There 's a beast used to live at my house -- its hairy hand swirled the toilet-bowl where it frothed at the mouth and gurgled , screaming obscenities down the S-bend
Its breath fogged up the shower screen steaming the bathroom walls as it urinated grey soapy sludge in a curl past the pubic hairs in the plughole
Its fiery nostrils burnt my wrists leaving scars as sublimely white as the office starched collars and cuffs and the barrister 's jabot beneath the iron
Its toenail clippings gritted my bare feet biting and scratching their soles as I trudged across the sticky kitchen floor wielding a bucket and mop for protection
Its arms wrenched the washing in the machine contorting it into strange knots and tangles which unravelled slowly and flapped tiresomely beyond the reach of the pegs on the line
Its Body Odour was of stale frying food mixed with hairbrushes soaked in ammonia -- its armpits were sprayed with Exit Mould and it used pyrethrin shampoo on its hair
The Beast moved into my house in my youth I fought and wrestled with it until middle age when at last I sang and danced my depths with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
