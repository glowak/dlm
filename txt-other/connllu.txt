# text = Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas called suicide a grievous sin and located its source within the deficient person ; Rousseau emphasized the natural and innocent state of man and transferred the locus of blame from man to society ; Hume tried to sanitize suicide entirely by arguing that it was neither a crime nor a sin ; Durkheim focused on society 's inimical effects on the individual ; and Freud , eschewing the notions of sin and crime , gave suicide back to the individual but put the main locus of action in the unconscious mind .
